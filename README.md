# Git Encrypt Scrips

#1. Clone repo into ~/.gitencrypt

#2. Run ./create_credentials.sh

This creates a .credentials file in the current directory.

#3. Say... That's a nice repo you have there. Shame if something were to happen to it...

Backup your .credentials file into your password manager of choice.
